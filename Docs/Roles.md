## Player Roles

**Captain**
The big decision-maker. They listen to everyone’s ideas, sort through the chaos, then point the ship in the right direction.

The Captain’s final call sets the course of action.

**Helmsman**
Think of them as the pilot and driver. They handle the ship’s speed, steering, docking, and fancy footwork during battles.

**Tactical**
Armed with weapons and defenses, the Tactician chooses how to hit hard and when to hunker down behind shields. They also pick up on enemy weaknesses and tactical advantages.

**Science**
The brainy one. They scan anomalies, catalog weird stuff, and help adjust equipment frequencies. They also study star maps and figure out what’s going on out there.

**Operations**
The crew’s coordinator. They handle repairs, shuttle missions, medical emergencies, and send NPC crew where needed.

**Engineering**
They keep the lights on and the engines humming. Engineers juggle energy and heat levels so nothing explodes, ensuring all systems run smoothly.

**Communications**
They talk to everyone else in the galaxy. They handle diplomacy, negotiate treaties, request docking, and sometimes sneakily listen in on enemy plans.
